## ✨ Features

This portfolio is more than just a static page. It includes several features designed to create a polished and engaging user experience:

- **Modern & Responsive Design:** Built with CSS Flexbox and Grid, the layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops.
- **Interactive UI with Sound:** Subtle hover and click sound effects are implemented using JavaScript for a unique and responsive feel.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links provide a smooth scrolling experience between sections.
- **Dynamic Copyright Year:** The copyright year in the footer is automatically updated using JavaScript, so it's always current.
- **AJAX Contact Form:** The contact form uses Formspree and is submitted via an AJAX call, preventing page reloads and displaying a success message dynamically.
- **Scroll Animations:** Elements and cards gracefully fade into view as you scroll down the page, thanks to the Intersection Observer API.
- **Clean & Organized Code:** The project follows best practices by separating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

2.  **Styling:** Colors, fonts, and spacing can be modified in the `style.css` file.
3.  **Images & CV:** Replace `my-photo.png`, `my-running-photo.jpg`, and `Mohamad-Albeik-CV.pdf` with your own files.
4.  **Favicons:** Generate your own set of favicons using a tool like RealFaviconGenerator and replace the existing icon files.
5.  **Contact Form:** To receive messages from the contact form, create your own Formspree endpoint and replace the URL in the `action` attribute of the form in `index.html` and in the `fetch` call within `script.js`.
